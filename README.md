# Password Complexity Checker 

A simple, interactive password strength checker built using Python's `tkinter` library. This application provides **real-time feedback** as the user types, highlighting the remaining criteria needed to make the password strong.

## Features

- **Real-Time Feedback**: As the user types, the program checks the password strength and lists the missing criteria.
- **Password Complexity Criteria**:
  - Must be at least 8 characters long
  - Must contain at least 1 digit
  - Must contain at least 1 lowercase letter
  - Must contain at least 1 uppercase letter
  - Must contain at least 1 special character (e.g., `!@#$%^&*`)
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and easy-to-use graphical interface built with `tkinter`.
